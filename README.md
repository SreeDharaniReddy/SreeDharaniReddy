# 👋 Hey there, I'm Sree Dharani!

I'm a graduate student at Northeastern University, exploring everything from machine learning and deep learning pipelines to end-to-end data engineering and real-world AI applications. I love building intelligent systems that connect data, models, and meaningful outcomes — whether it's a predictive model, a RAG pipeline, a streaming data workflow, or a dashboard that tells powerful stories.
